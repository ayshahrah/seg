# Software Engineering Guide

**Software Engineering Guide (SEG)** is a self-learning roadmap for practitioners in software engineering. It is role-based and includes a curated list of free-of-cost learning resources. For each role, there are four levels: foundation, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The learning resources are being collected from highly-respected and well-trusted sources.

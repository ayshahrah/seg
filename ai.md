## Welcome to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine or computer system to copy human intelligence processes, learn from experiences, adapt to new information and perform human-like activities. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.

AI is a wide field of study -- incorporating various technologies, methods and theories -- that focuses on combining large amounts of data with defined rules and fast, repetitive processing. This enables the software to advance and improve its ability to complete tasks by recognizing patterns and features in the data sets.

Self-driving cars and computers that play chess are two examples of machines with artificial intelligence. In addition, a variety of industries have begun using AI to improve their work processes -- such as healthcare, manufacturing, banking and retail. In addition, AI is finding multiple beneficial uses in cybersecurity.

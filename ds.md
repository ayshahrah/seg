## Welcome to Data Science

Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organization's competitive advantage.

The data science field employs mathematics, statistics and computer science disciplines, and incorporates techniques like machine learning, cluster analysis, data mining and visualization.

As the amount of data generated by the typical modern business increases, so does the prominence of data scientists hired by organizations to help them turn raw data into valuable business information. Data extraction is the act of retrieving specific data from unstructured or poorly structured data sources for further processing and investigation. Data scientists must possess a combination of analytic, machine learning, data mining and statistical skills, as well as experience with algorithms and coding. Along with managing and interpreting large amounts of data, many data scientists are also tasked with creating data visualization models that help illustrate the business value of digital information.

## Welcome to Software Engineering Guide

**Software Engineering Guide (SEG)** is a self-learning roadmap with a curated list of high-quality and free-of-cost learning resources in software engineering domain. SEG is a role-based guide that is organized into specialized learning paths. SEG covers the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) knowledge domains that represent the most popular working roles related to software engineering. Each learning path has an overview section and a set of structured online learning resources that are organized into four levels: foundation, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each level has a variety of online learning resources that are categorized into three types: MOOCs, webinars, and others. These learning resources are collected from highly-respected and well-trusted sources.

### Motivation

The motivation behind building this guide is the existing gap between the knowledge and skills that are acquired from traditional education offerings and the ones that are demanded today by industry--especially at the places with low-quality education. However, nowadays, with the availability and affordability of internet connectivity, you can easily gain a free-of-cost access to high-quality learning resources from around the world. *Therefore, there is no excuse to say that I don't have a quality education!*

### Relationship

Software engineering is a broad field that encompasses so many different sub-specializations and interrelates to many other foundational computing fields, such as computer science, computer engineering, and data science. Therefore, to be a professional in software engineering, you need to have a foundational background on software engineering and its related fields (it is being taught in bachelor degree of software engineering). Eventhough, that is not enough to master a specific software engineering sub-domain and you need to get into a software engineering sub-specialization (role-based).

### Principles

To be a professional in software engineering, you have to guide yourself by adopting some important principles, including purpose, ambition, passion, focus, self-motivation, self-learning, seriousness, and patience. Without such principles, it would be very difficult to be in a mastery level of software engineering.

### Framework

The SEG is inspired by a framework that combines three essential components to master software engineering, including learner (acquiring technical and non-technical skills), methodology (adopting lean, agile, and DevOps), and technology (using next-generation technologies, such as ALM, IoT, cloud computing, etc.).

### Knowledge Areas

The SEG is mainly developed based on the main knowledge areas of software development lifecycle (SDLC) included in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge ([SWEBOK V3](https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3)). Furthermore, these knowledge areas are mapped to the most popular software engineering related roles available today in the industry.

### Learning Paths

The SEG currently includes ten different role-based learning paths (specializations). SEG provides guiding information and learning resources for each learning path. In addition, each learning path is associated with a LinkedIn group to facilitate knowledge sharing and professional networking.

### Interpersonal Skills

Technical skills are not enough to be a professional in software engineering! In today's competitive working environments, soft skills are imperative and not less important than technical skills. Furthermore, developing a new business or establishing a tech start-up needs an additional type of a skill-set in entrepreneurship.

### Learning Process

To get a full advantage of this guide, it is highly recommended to first select a role from the specialized learning paths listed above. Then, begin the following self-development process: learning, practicing, networking, and teaching. These steps are overlapped, iterative, and should be a life-long journey.

![](Slide9.JPG "Methodology") 

- **Learning**: a self-learning process to increase the learner's knowledge based on available online resources. The learner can leverage the collected resources available in this guide for each specialized role. These collections contain up-to-date, high-quality, and free-of-cost online learning resources.

- **Practicing**: using software tools and technologies to improve the learner's skills. The learner can utilize open source and free software tools, and also can gain a trial access to some commercial software tools to apply the acquired knowledge.

- **Networking**: joining and connecting with professional specialized online communities. This allows the learner to keep updated with latest trends and technologies in a selected learning path. Moreover, the learner can ask and communicate with specialized experts in case of any doubt or ambiguity.

- **Teaching**: helps in getting serious, sharing knowledge, and improving soft skills. Through this process, the learner can interact with others and gain non-technical (soft) skills like confidence, communication, presentation, speaking, etc.

### Learning Outcomes

| Level        | Description           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| **Foundation**     | Explains how to learn and provides an overall background in software engineering | Understanding the importance of self-learning and software engineering|
| **Beginner**     | Focuses on basic knowledge and skills of a particular learning path | Understanding the fundamentals of a selected learning path |
| **Intermediate** | Focuses on agile approaches and application life-cycle management software (ALM) | The ability to develop prototypes using an agile approach and ALM software |
| **Advanced** | Focuses on next-generation technologies (e.g. internet-of-things and cloud computing) and approaches (e.g. DevOps)      |    The ability to develop next-generation applications using cloud computing and DevOps approach |

### Performance Measurement

It is very important for any professional in software engineering to measure his/her learning progress towards learning objectives and future career path. From a practical perspective, this can be achieved by different means (achievement-based), such as delivering a technical presentation, demonstrating a piece of a developed prototype or a fully functioning application, or acquiring a professional certification in a particular domain.

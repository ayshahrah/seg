## Welcome to Software Construction

The term software construction refers to the detailed creation of working software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging. The Software Construction is most strongly linked to Software Design and Software Testing because the software construction process involves significant software design and testing. The process uses the design output and provides an input to testing. Boundaries between design, construction, and testing (if any) will vary depending on the software life cycle processes that are used in a project.

Although some detailed design may be performed prior to construction, much design work is performed during the construction activity. Thus, the Software Construction is closely linked to the Software Design . Throughout construction, software engineers both unit test and integration test their work. Thus, the Software Construction is closely linked to the Software Testing as well.

Software construction typically produces the highest number of configuration items that need to be managed in a software project (source files, documentation, test cases, and so on). Thus, the Software Construction is also closely linked to the Software Configuration Management. Code is the ultimate deliverable of a software project, and thus the Software Quality is closely linked to the Software Construction.

Since software construction requires knowledge of algorithms and of coding practices, it is closely related to the Computing Foundations, which is concerned with the computer science foundations that support the design and construction of software products. It is also related to project management, insofar as the management of construction can present considerable challenges.

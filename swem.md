## Welcome to Software Engineering Management

Software engineering management can be defined as the application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that software products and software engineering services are delivered efficiently, effectively, and to the benefit of stakeholders.

In one sense, it should be possible to manage a software engineering project in the same way other complex endeavors are managed. However, there are aspects specific to software projects and software life cycle processes that complicate effective management, including these:
- Clients often don’t know what is needed or what is feasible.
- Clients often lack appreciation for the complexities inherent in software engineering, particularly regarding the impact of changing requirements.
- It is likely that increased understanding and changing conditions will generate new or changed software requirements.
- As a result of changing requirements, software is often built using an iterative process rather than as a sequence of closed tasks.
- Software engineering necessarily incorporates creativity and discipline. Maintaining an appropriate balance between the two is sometimes difficult.
- The degree of novelty and complexity is often high.
- There is often a rapid rate of change in the underlying technology.
